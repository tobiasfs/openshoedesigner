# Materials

This folder contains zipped material descriptions.

Download some materials from e.g. [Ambient CG](https://ambientcg.com/list?type=material) to be used in the displaying of the shoe designs.

It is completely enough to download the smallest ..._1K-JPG.zip of a material.

For example: 

 * Some [Leather](https://ambientcg.com/list?type=material%2Cdecal%2Catlas&q=leather&sort=popular) materials for uppers
 * Some variants of [Wood](https://ambientcg.com/list?type=material%2Cdecal%2Catlas&q=wood&sort=popular) for heels and floors
 * [Carpets](https://ambientcg.com/list?type=material%2Cdecal%2Catlas&q=carpet&sort=popular)
 * [Plastic](https://ambientcg.com/list?type=material%2Cdecal%2Catlas&q=plastic&sort=popular) and [Metals](https://ambientcg.com/list?type=material%2Cdecal%2Catlas&q=metal&sort=popular) for heels
 
The downloaded files should be put into this folder without unpacking or renaming.
