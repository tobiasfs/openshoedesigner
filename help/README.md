# Open Shoe Designer - Users Manual

With the right shoes, You forget Your feet.

## Introduction

This software is intended for shoe design. It consists of a lastgenerator, that uses a model of the foot to generate the last. The shoe is designed onto the last. Patterns for the upper part of the shoe are generated from the design. Pattern / models for the sole are generated as well.

To generate the form of the last this software modells the bones and the skin surrounding the bones in the foot. An volume model of the foot is constructed. This model is modified to distrubute the forces on the foot by the shoe. For example You want a tight hold across the span, but You do not want any forces on the toes or directly from the front on the bones. Depending on the heel height the last has to be adapted around the heel to prevent the foot slipping out of the shoe. Also no moments have to be applied on the ancles from the side while standing straight.

These modification result in the last.

By setting up a coordinate system on he last and defining the pattern with respect to this coordinate system, the form of the last and the design of the pattern can be kept separately. A shoe can be adapted to a new wearer by simply exchanging the last. Even changes to the inclination and heel height of a shoe can be changed after the design has been finished. 

By using this approach, the manufacturer can easiely adapt the design to a whole range of lasts and also easiely create different forms based for the typical foot forms in differnt places of the planet and adapt the design to differnt toe forms: Egyptian, Greek or Roman foot.

### Foot model

The basic foot model is based upon a skeletal model. The length and the diameters of the bones are adapted until the foot fits an e.g. outline drawing with differnt grith measurements or a 3D scan of the of the foot. The skin thickness and density is estimated as well. It is used to model the compressibility of the foot under different forces. For the upper part of the leg simple length and circumfence measurements are used. 

### Lasts

In the process of shoemaking the last assists the shoemaker in constructing a well fitting shoe. It helps forming the leather to give the wearer of the shoe a snug fit without squeezig the foot.

For industrial shoes there is a trend to simplify the lasts more and more. 

## Shoesizes

Almost ever country has its own system for measuring shoe sizes. Here is an overview on the different systems.

### Europe

The length of the last in Parisian Point ("Pariser Punkt"). One Parisian Point is 2/3 of a centimeter. 

EU size = (Footlength + 2 cm) * 2 / 3 cm

in Europe the shoesizes are normal distributed. For female sizes the mean shoesize is at 39 with a standard deviation of 2. For males the mean is at 41 and the standard deviation is 3.

### USA

Different systems for male and female feet. The formulas are:

### Japan

They use a direct measurement of the lengh of the foot in cm as their shoe sizeing system.

### UK

## Shoestyles

There are many styles. I reference here the styles mentioned by Oskar Belsching in his standard volume on industrial shoemaking. These styles are optimized for efficient production in large numbers.

Modern styles are almost always deviations of these styles. To sell shoes in high volumes, it is necessary to keep with the tast of the masses. Very exotic and out-of-the-norm designs are not selling very well. If You want to walk this way You have to start from one of the standart designs and improvise from there.

The pattern generator uses these standard designs to generate templates of the upper part of the shoe. It uses the templates and tries to stretch them around the last / the extended last (with leg).

## History

A shoes main purpose is to protect the feet. To keep them warm and to repell dirt and water. The shoe as an fashion-statement only happened recently. Starting in noble circles the shoe shloly started loosing its function as means of protecting the foot, because the environment hey were worn in was not as spoiled as it was for the peasents. The shoe as a status symbol came into fashion.

Later the strong separation between the work-shoes of the common people and the fashion shoes of the [hohen Herrschaften] diffused more and more and mixed into what was to become the modern shoe. As the boundaries shmeared a wide variety of styles came into existence. Not on the axis of status but on the axis of purpose.
